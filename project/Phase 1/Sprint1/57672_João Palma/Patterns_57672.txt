Design Patterns:

1 - Composite
scr -> logic -> bst -> VM
lines -> 102/104

public interface BstFunction {
	void execute(BstEntry context);
}


"VM" is a common interface which is used for different objects that do the same thing 
in different contexts, such as, on "TextPrefixFunction" class, "FormatNameFunction" class, 
"ChangeCaseFunction" class, "PurifyFunction" class and "WidthFunction" class. 


2 - Template
scr -> logic -> formatter -> bibtexfields -> Formatter
Entire class

Class used to define the skeleton code of an algorithm in the superclass and use 
subclasses to override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
Examples of subclasses that extend superclass "Formatter": "NormalizeNamesFormatter", 
"NormalizeMonthFormatter", "NormalizeEnDashesFormatter", "NormalizePagesFormatter" and 
"NormalizeDateFormatter".


3 - Facade
scr -> logic-> importer -> WebFetcher(interface) and WebFetchers(class)
Interface and Class

Used a simple interface to a complex subsystem of classes
The "WebFetcher" interface implemented in the "WebFetchers" class is used in many classes
and provides a simplified and straightforward way to get the information needed.
