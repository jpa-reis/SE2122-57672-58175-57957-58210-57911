Code smells:

1- Data Class
File: src/prefences/AppearencePreferences
Lines: (whole class)

By looking at the methods in this class we notice that all of them
are getters or setters this is Data class code smell.

In this case there is not much you can do to preferences except
get the current preference or change, so although this is a code
smell it should stay this way, to prevent worst code smells.


2- Long parameter list
File: src/cli/ArgumentProcessor
Lines: 275

    private void writeMetadatatoPdf(List<ParserResult> loaded, String filesAndCitekeys, Charset encoding, XmpPreferences xmpPreferences, FilePreferences filePreferences, BibDatabaseMode databaseMode, BibEntryTypesManager entryTypesManager, FieldWriterPreferences fieldWriterPreferences, boolean writeXMP, boolean embeddBibfile) {
    ...
    }

Being close to 300 chars long this method parameter list is obviouly
to long, to remedy this we can group some of the parameters into a parameter object



3- Lack of comments
File: src/cli/ArgumentProcessor
Lines: 275

    private void writeMetadatatoPdf(List<ParserResult> loaded, String filesAndCitekeys, Charset encoding, XmpPreferences xmpPreferences, FilePreferences filePreferences, BibDatabaseMode databaseMode, BibEntryTypesManager entryTypesManager, FieldWriterPreferences fieldWriterPreferences, boolean writeXMP, boolean embeddBibfile) {
    ...
    }

In this class we can see a lack of comments for each method this is
aggravated by the fact this method has a long parameter list making it
harder to understand.
