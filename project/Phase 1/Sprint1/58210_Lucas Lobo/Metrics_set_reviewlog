Comments: Good but could be better. I would suggest a couple of changes to improve the document:

1 - First, the AHF and MFH descriptions should be changed to "relates to the number of attributes/methods *NOT* seen by other classes",
instead of the current "relates to the number of attributes/methods seen by other classes", as I at least didn't find it clear
enough during an initial read.

2 - Metrics like AIF, MIF and PF would greatly benefit from a small description of what they are, even if it's already somewhat clear
from their name.

3 - CF explains that it measures "coupling" but it's not clear what "coupling" is. A small explanation would be most helpful.

4 - In the PF description you wrote: "(...)which can cause debugging, by tracing the control flow harder.". I'm not exactly sure what
you're trying to say here?

5 - Finally, the document itself needs a bit more polish. The tables are great and really well done but the text itself has a few weird
phrases and issues previously stated.
The last major things I can spot is stuff like "PF - Polymorphism Factor AHF", which doesn't need the "AHF" at the end, and how you
introduce some metrics with "METRIC(metric name)," and others with "METRIC - metric name,". I think you should decide between one of those
and just use that one.



Reviewee(Lucas): Thanks for the feedback, it was very helpful. I have tried to fix the problems to the best of my ability.
