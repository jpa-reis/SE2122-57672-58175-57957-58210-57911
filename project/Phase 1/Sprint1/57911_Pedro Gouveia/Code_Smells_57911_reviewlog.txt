Code Smells:

1 - Reviewer: Lucas Lobo 58210
    Comments: "sb.append(c);" should be executed even if "escaped == true", which does not happen in the new code.


2 - Reviewed by João Santos: Small mistake in the solution: minusHours() in only used in the method isDuringLastDay(), minusDays()
is used in other methods instead. To fix this I suggest the use of an "if" statement:

...
    if(timeScale==7)
        return fileEditTime.isAfter(NOW.minusHours(timeScale));
    else
        return fileEditTime.isAfter(NOW.minusDays(timeScale));
...

    Commentary: The code smell is right and the solution is correct. Even though de case does effectively nothing it creates clutter.
